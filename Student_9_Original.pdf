50 510 Td (Philosophical questions about consciousness and personhood become pressing as AI capabilities grow. If machines achieve general intelligence, what moral status should they hold? How do we define and measure consciousness? These questions move from abstract philosophy to practical policy concerns.) Tj 0 -20 Td
50 490 Td () Tj 0 -20 Td
50 470 Td (International cooperation offers the best path forward. No single nation can address AI challenges alone. Shared standards, collaborative research, and mutual accountability create conditions for beneficial AI development. Our collective choices today determine whether AI becomes a tool for human flourishing or a source of division and harm.) Tj 0 -20 Td
